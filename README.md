# Checkers
The game of Checkers with separate game engine if want to do a different UI

Game is dependent on the GameStatistics assembly library along with the internal
CheckersRulesEngine assembly.  Since engine is separate, can be used in other
game implementations of Checkers is so desired.  The A/I of the engine is pretty
weak, but does do ok playing against casual players or itself if so wanted.
Game last updated/compiled using VS 2019
