      <p>Checkers (or Draughts) is a game played by two opponents on either side of a checker board. This game
         of checkers is played on an 8 x 8 checker board with each player starting out with 12 checkers. A random
         draw picks which player will go first and play commences by moving a checker piece diagonally forward on
         the checker board. If an opponents checker is next to a players checker and the diagonal square behind it is
         empty, they can "jump" that checker and remove it from the board. If an additional jump can be made after
         the first jump, the player can continue jumping until no more jumps can be made. Moves (or jumps) can only
         be made towards the opponents side of the board unless the checker is crowned (a king).
      <p>If a player moves (or jumps) one of their checkers to the opponents side of the board, the checker piece
         is "crowned" and becomes a king. The crowned checker (or king) can then move (or jump) diagonally backwards.
      <p>Moves (or jumps) in this game are done by dragging the checker piece with the mouse from the starting
         square to another valid square. Only on valid squares can the checker piece be dropped. Once a move is
         made, the players turn ends and the other player goes. If a jump is made, the player can continue jumping
         until no more jumps can be made. A player making jumps with additional jumps left can take back their jump move
         if so desired. If no more jumps can be made, the turn is considered done and the player cannot take
         back their jump.
      <p>Once one player or the other has either lost all of their checker pieces or cannot move, they have lost
         the game and the other player wins.

	  <p><div style="font-weight:bold;">Options:</div>
      <p>There are multiple options available to add variety to the game of checkers. Options are updated and saved
         when OK is pressed. If Cancel is pressed, options are not changed. The Defaults buttons restores the options
         to the default values. OK still needs to be pressed to update and save the default values.
      <ul>
        <li>Checker colors - select from 8 colors for each checker side.
        <li>Use alternate starting positions - checkers start at the top corner square instead of the second
            square. Takes affect with the next new game started.
        <li>Checker board square colors - cannot be the same color.
        <li>Checker board border color - cannot be the same color.
        <li>Players on each side - can select human or computer player for each side.
        <li>Crown style - image to use for the crown for a checker that's become a king.
        <li>Jump allowed after crowning - allows a new king to continue jumping, if can, and if king was made by
            jumping to the opponents side.
      </ul>
      <p>A good set of options to use (for a rustic, wooden set) is:
      <ul>
        <li>Checker color 1 = LightWood
        <li>Checker color 2 = DarkWood
        <li>Checker board square color 1 = Tan
        <li>Checker board square color 2 = Sienna
        <li>Checker board border color = Moccasin
      </ul>
